# NOTICE
> this project was supposed to be written in bun, but i'm going to do rust instead. all the code in this branch is pretty much useless. check out the cert branch for some wip stuff that works.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
